# User Dashboard for Lendsqr

## Description

This project was created using SCSS, ReactJS, TypeScript, and additional frameworks such as react-icon. Its development was undertaken to meet the requirements for the position of a frontend developer at Lendsqr.
The website serves as a straightforward user dashboard that presents a wide range of information, including user loan details and personal data. It offers insights into various aspects such as organizations, user status, and more, particularly for lenders. The data utilized for building this site was sourced from a JSON generator, which significantly facilitated the development process.

In the development phase, IndexedDB was employed for multiple purposes. Initially, it was used to store the details of logged-in users, enabling authentication for access to other routes. Additionally, IndexedDB was utilized for storing individual user information, offering a versatile solution for data management.

The user dashboard provides detailed information about user loans, personal data, organizations, and statuses of lenders. The data used in this project was obtained from JSON Generator, simplifying the development process. Testing was carried out using react testing library (jest). The userdashboard and login components were tested.
